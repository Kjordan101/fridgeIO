  <h3 id = "all-h3">Our team at fridgeIO seeks to revolutionize the shopping
    experience as we know it. Have you ever been at the freezer
    section of Target, staring for a half hour at a box of Eggo waffles,
    wondering if you should buy a box even though you might have a box at home? Or you might
  even know for a fact that you have a box of Eggos, but you don't
  remember if they expired yet.</h3>

    <h3 id = "all-h3">This is a rhetorical question. We’ve all been there; don’t lie.</h3>
    <h3 id = "all-h3">With fridgeIO, this nightmare will be one less thing for you to worry about.
      Essentially, the first time that you put an item on your grocery list,
      you'll also put in the expiraton date or the day you expect to finish the product.
    When that day comes, you'll receive a notification telling you to re-buy the
  product. So if your waffles expired or ran out, you'll know.</h3>

  <h3 id = "all-h3">**Happy shopping**</h3>
